Ig-microservices is an Instagram clone built with Java using Spring Boot as the framework.
The app uses JWT-based authentication for secure user access, Kafka for message-based communication through producers 
and consumers, Docker Compose for setting up the infrastructure, and PostgreSQL as the primary relational database.
